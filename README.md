Hi there! I'm a Backend Developer who loves digging deep into the core of every problem! (•̀ᴗ•́)و ̑̑<br>
I don’t settle for surface-level understanding—I keep diving until I truly grasp the underlying principles.<br>
- Growth Mindset: I’m not afraid of trial and error. Every mistake is a stepping stone, and every challenge is a chance to grow.
- Consistency: I believe that steady progress—no matter how small—builds the path to becoming a solid engineer. 🚀
