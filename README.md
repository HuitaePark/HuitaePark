>I'm an aspiring backend developer who loves digging deep into the core of every problem! (•̀ᴗ•́)و ̑̑<br>
> <br>
>I don’t settle for surface-level understanding—I keep going until I truly grasp the underlying principles.<br>
> I’m not afraid of trial and error. Every mistake is a stepping stone, and every challenge is a chance to grow.<br>
> I believe that consistent, steady progress—no matter how small—builds the path to becoming a better developer. 🚀
